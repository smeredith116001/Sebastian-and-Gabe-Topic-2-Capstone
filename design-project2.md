## Design Project 2 - MAAS
Sebastian and Gabe are starting a new project for design project 2 and because of that this project will be focused on research MAAS. We have decided to take this time to learn everything we can about MAAS before jumping into a full on project. This will allow us to create a better final project more effeciently than we would be able to otherwise.
